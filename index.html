<h1>[map] BBCode</h1>

<p>It is sad to see that while maps and geodata are trending, there is no reasonable solution to embed maps
in any of forum engines. Users of <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/">SkyscraperCity</a>, the leading forum on
tall buildings, transport infrastructure and urban development, cannot use maps to show what they are discussing.
Cycling forums don't have route maps in their weekend journeys topics. Hikers cannot place photos taken in a recent
trip on a map. Offroad clubs still have to rely on arrays of GPS waypoints for their activities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, recent technological advancements in web mapping, namely <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>
library and its plugins, made it possible to create a simple solution for embedding maps in forums. In October the library
for parsing, displaying and editing <a href="bbcode.html">[map] bbcode</a> was finally released. With luck, this tag will
become as common on forums as [img] and [url].</p>

<p>Please help us expand this list! There is an extensive <a href="embedding.html">documentation</a> on integrating [map] bbcode with forum engines. It doesn't even have to be a forum: blog and CMS plugins are also welcome. And does not rely on using <a href="#sample" onclick="javascript:replaceMap(); return true;">actual maps</a>. You can use the library in your project to display maps or to provide a complete mapping experience for your users. To showcase it, we have made an <a href="https://github.com/MapBBCode/share.mapbbcode.org">open-source</a> website to create and share user maps:</p>

<p>The MapBBCode library and most examples were written by Ilya Zverev and published under WTFPL license where possible. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mapbbcode">@mapbbcode</a> for news.</p>
