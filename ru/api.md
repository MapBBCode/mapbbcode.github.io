`MapBBCode.js` methods are explained on the [BBCode page](bbcode.html). In `MapBBCodeUI.js` and `MapBBCodeUI.Editor.js` there are only 4 public methods combined. Note that when built separately, UI scripts require `MapBBCode.js`, `EditorSprites.js` (base64 contents of a PNG image with button icons) and `FunctionButton.js` (see below). They also support all other modules described in the last chapter, but can work without them.

## Methods

* `setStrings( <Object> strings )`: replaces strings with provided translations. See `strings/English.js` for default values.
* `show( <HTMLElement/String> div, <String/HTMLElement> bbcode )`: creates a map inside a given element (can be referenced by id) for given bbcode. can be extracted from an HTML element: it can be in `bbcode` or `value` attributes, or inside it.
* `showExternal( <HTMLElement/String> div, <String> id )`: download a map from a map sharing service and display it, along with an export button and a link to the service.
* `editor( <HTMLElement/String> div, <String/HTMLTextArea> bbcode, callback, context )`: creates an editor in the given panel, possibly pre-initialized with bbcode. The latter is either a string or a textarea, in latter case caret position is taken into account, and the code is replaced after applying changes.
    Calls `callback` when "Apply" or "Cancel" buttons are clicked, with a single parameter of new bbcode.
* `editorWindow( <String/HTMLTextArea> bbcode, callback, context )`: opens a new window with an editor for given bbcode (see `editor()`). Does not return anything.

Methods `show` and `editor` return an object with a `map` property, `editor` flag and methods to control the panel:

* `close()`: removes all elements, "closes" the panel.
* `zoomToData()`: zooms and pans the map view to the data.
* `getBBCode()`: returns BBCode string for objects currently displayed.
* `updateBBCode( <String> bbcode, <Boolean> noZoom )`: removes all objects in a panel and replaces them with those defined in the given bbcode. If `noZoom` is `true`, doesn't zoom and pan to new objects.

## Options

Usually configurable by a forum administrator:

| Option | Type | Default | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `defaultPosition` | Number[] | `[22, 11]` | Coordinates of the center of a map when opened with empty bbcode.
| `defaultZoom` | Number | `2` | Default zoom of a map when bbcode is empty.
| `viewWidth` | Number | `600` | Width of a map panel when displaying a bbcode. Here and below `0` means `100%`.
| `viewHeight` | Number | `300` | Height of a map panel when displaying a bbcode.
| `fullViewHeight` | Number | `600` | Height of an expanded map panel. Width is always `100%`.

## Parameter Processors

Since the [BBCode specification](BBCODE.md) states that the only customizable part of [map] bbcode is object parameter set, parameter processing and editing panels in the editor have been made pluggable. There are two mandatory modules (text and color) and several example modules.

To create a new parameter module, you have to push to `window.MapBBCode.objectParams` array an object with the following properties and methods (only the first four are mandatory):

* `<RegExp>   reKeys`: regular expression that matches parameters processed by this module.
* `<Boolean>  applicableTo( <ILayer> layer )`: tests that given layer can contain module's properties.
* `           objectToLayer( <ILayer> layer, <String[]> params, <MapBBCode> ui )`: modifies the layer according to the properties, which are filtered by `reKeys`, so there usually is no more than one.
* `<String[]> layerToObject( <ILayer> layer, <String[]> lastParams, <MapBBCode> ui )`: reads properties off the layer and returns them in a string array. `lastParams` array contains properties that the object had before it was edited.
* `           initLayer( <ILayer> layer )`: initializes newly created layer with default property values.
* `           initDrawControl( <Control.Draw> draw )`: modifies [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/leaflet/leaflet.draw) control according to default property values.
* `<HTMLElement> createEditorPanel( <ILayer>layer, <MapBBCode> ui )`: creates a panel that will be included in an object popup. It should read and allow editing the property that's processed by the module.

# Configuration Tool

To simplify configuring map panel dimensions and a list of available layers, there is a separate javascript module that can be easily integrated in an administration panel.
It requires `window.layerList` and `L.StaticLayerSwitcher` for easier editing of layers. See [EMBEDDING.md](EMBEDDING.md#administration-panel) for a guide on integration.

## Options

The `MapBBCodeConfig` class includes all options listed above in "configurable by a forum administrator" table, except the last three (`preferStandardLayerSwitcher`, `allowedHTML` and `outerLinkTemplate`). Instead there are additional options for configuring the configuration panel:

| Option | Type | Default | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `editorInWindow` | Boolean | `true` | Whether the editor is opened in a window or in an inline panel.
| `editorTypeFixed` | Boolean | `false` | Whether an administrator can change the above option, or the type is hard-coded into a template.
| `maxLayers` | Number | `5` | Maximum number of layers on a map.

## Methods

* `setStrings( <Object> strings )`: replaces strings with provided translations. See `strings/English.Config.js` for default values.
* `addLayer( <String> id )`: adds a layer to the list. See `window.layerList`.
* `show( <HTMLElement/String> div )`: shows a map panel with controls inside a given element (can be specified by its id).
* `bindLayerAdder( <Object> elements )`: adds listeners and labels to several input elements for adding layers:

| bindLayerAdder option | What does it reference
|---|---
| `select` | `<select size="1">` for a layer list
| `button` | `<input type="button">` for adding a selected layer
| `keyBlock` | an initially hidden block for entering a key for layers that require it
| `keyBlockDisplay` | `display` CSS value for that block
| `keyTitle` | `<span>` where a title for key input field will be inserted
| `keyValue` | `<input type="text">` for entering a key

## Events

There are a number of [Leaflet events](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#events) that the panel emits.

| Event | Data | When fired
|---|---|---
| `show` | options object | Configuration panel has been created.
| `change` | options object | Any of the options were changed.
| `layerselected` | `{ <String> id }` | A user selected another layer (does not affect options).

# Leaflet Plugins

## L.LetterIcon

A round icon with a white border and text inside. Can be used to display markers that don't require clicking or hovering over to see their labels.

| Option | Type | Default | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `color` | String | `'black'` | CSS color of icon background.
| `radius` | Number | `11` | Icon radius.

## L.PopupIcon

An icon that looks like a popup panel, but significantly smaller. Title should be passed to the constructor. Has only one option: `width` for maximum icon width.

## L.FunctionButtons

This control simplifies creating simple Leaflet controls that invoke javascript functions when clicked. It supports multiple actions on one control: in that case they are stacked vertically, like on a standard zoom control.

Class contructor accepts two parameters: an array of labels for actions (strings, image URLs or html elements) and an options object. The latter may contain `titles` array of strings, which would be used as title attributes, and `bgPos` array of [dx, dy] arrays that define offsets for image content. Other options (one option, actually: `position`) are inherited from the [L.Control](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control) class.

An action inside a function button can be updated with `setContent(id, content)` and `setTitle(id, title)` methods. Image content offset can be altered with `setBgPos(id, bgPos)` method.

When clicked, the control emits a Leaflet event `clicked` with a single data property, `idx`: zero-based index of an action that was selected.

### L.FunctionButton

This is a subclass of `L.FunctionButtons` designed to work with a single action. It accepts a single object with options in the contructor, its `setContent()`, `setTitle()` and `setBgPos()` methods accept a single parameter.

## L.StaticLayerSwitcher

This control can replace the standard Leaflet layers control. It allows a user to switch layers and, if `editable` property is set, to remove layers and change their order. This control differs from the stanard one in two ways:

* It does not support overlay layers.
* It fully controls layers included in a map, to the point of removing any layer that it doesn't have listed.

Each layer has to have a label (id). It is either specified on adding, or included in the layer's `options` object as a `name` property. The plugin can be used together with `window.layerList` module: in this case layers can be managed as a list of ids.

The constructor accepts two parameters. The first one is a layer list, either an array of ids or an object `{ id: layer, ... }`. If a layer is not specified, it is requested from `window.layerList` for a given id. The second optional parameter is an options object with the following properties:

| Option | Type | Default | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `maxLayers` | Number | `7` | Maximum number of layers on a map.
| `bgColor` | String | `'white'` | Background CSS color of a layer switcher.
| `selectedColor` | String | `#ddd` | Background CSS color of a selected layer line.
| `editable` | Boolean | `false` | Whether a user can move and delete layers.

Those methods can be used to get and manipulate layers in a layer switcher:

* `<ILayer[]> getLayers()`: returns an array of layers included in a control, in their displayed order.
* `<String[]> getLayersIds()`: returns an array of layer identifiers included in a control, in their displayed order.
* `<ILayer>   getSelectedLayer()`: returns a currently selected layer.
* `<String>   getSelectedLayerId()`: returns an identifier of a currently selected layer.
* `<ILayer>   addLayer( <String> id, <ILayer> layer )`: appends a layer with given id to the end of the layer list. If `layer` is omitted, `window.layerList` is queried for a given `id`. Returns a layer that was added, or `null` if operation failed.
* `<ILayer>   updateLayer( <ILayer> layer, <String> id )`: updated an identifier for a layer. In case the layer was created by `window.layerList`, recreates it. Returns a layer, an id for which was updated, or `null` if operation failed.
* `<ILayer>   removeLayer( <ILayer> layer )`: Removes a layer from the list. Returns a layer that was removed, or `null` if operation failed.
* `           moveLayer( <ILayer> layer, <Boolean> moveDown )`: moves a layer in the list either up or down.

When active, the layer switcher emits following Leaflet events:

| Event | Data | When fired
|---|---|---
| `selectionchanged` | `{ <ILayer> selected, <String> selectedId }` | A user has changed active layer.
| `layerschanged` | `{ <String[]> layerIds }` | List of layers has been changed (only when it is editable).

## window.layerList

This object (not a class!) holds a list of layers that can be used on a leaflet map, and more specifically, as a MapBBCode base layer. It is by no means complete and includes only the most popular and distinctive layers.

The list itself is in the `list` property: it is an array of strings, which have to be passed to `eval()` to be converted into a Leaflet `ILayer` object. Some of entries contain `{key:<url>}` substring. It means that the layer requires a developer key (and the link is for its website). This substring has to be replaced with an actual key.

The object has some methods to simplify working with the layer list:

* `<String[]> getSortedKeys()`: returns a sorted list of layer keys (every key is essentially a human-readable label).
* `<Boolean>  requiresKey( <String> id )`: checks if the layer for a given id requires a developer key.
* `<String>   getKeyLink( <String> id )`: returns an URL for a developer key required for a layer, or an empty string if there is no URL or the layer does not need a key.
* `<ILayer[]> getLeafletLayers( <String[]> ids, <Leaflet> L )`: converts an array of ids to array of layers ready to be added to a Leaflet map.

## L.Control.Search

Every search control on the Leaflet plugins page has flaws. This is an attempt on making a simple, good-looking (though not as good as MapBox's closed-source one) search control. You just click a button, type a string and press Enter key. There are only two configurable options:

* `title`: title text on the control.
* `email`: e-mail address that will be sent to Nominatim server. It can be used for determining a source of suspicious activity. You should use this option, especially if the control is installed on a popular website.

## L.ExportControl

An export button for maps downloaded from an external service. Gets the supported formats list from the server.

| Option | Type | Default | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `name` | String | 'Export' | Text written on a button.
| `title` | String | `''` | Title text for the button.
| `endpoint` | String | 'http://share.mapbbcode.org/' | URL of the map sharing service.
| `codeid` | String | `''` | Identifier of a map to export.
| `types` | String[] | `[]` | List of supported formats (if empty, then it is downloaded).
| `titles` | String[] | `[]` | Titles for supported formats (if empty, then it is downloaded).

## L.Control.PermalinkAttribution

Replaces `L.Control.Attribution` with itself, so you won't have to do anything besides including the plugin script. Makes OpenStreetMap links in attribution into permanent links to the displayed place on osm.org website.

An option `attributionEditLink` is added to `L.Map` class. If it is set to `true`, OSM links will be followed by an edit link.
