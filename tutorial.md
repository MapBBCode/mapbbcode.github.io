To use MapBBCode, you would have to know JavaScript, at least the basics covered in the brilliant [MapBox.js Fundamentals](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/blob/master/JS.md) by Tom MacWright. You should also go through [Leaflet tutorials](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html): it may turn out you don't need MapBBCode Library, if Leaflet alone (with [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html)) can satisfy your needs. After all, MapBBCode is a little more that a Leaflet and Leaflet.draw wrapper, and if you don't need dynamic [map] bbcode, you can convert your data to a Leaflet-based HTML page with [MapBBCode Share](http://share.mapbbcode.org) service.

*The rest of this documentation will be finished in a week or two.*
